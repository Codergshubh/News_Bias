# News_Bias
Fine-tuned RoBERTa-base for news bias detection on 120 labeled headlines. Achieved 95% accuracy and 0.95 macro-F1 on the test set. Applied regularization to reduce overfitting and used LIME for interpretability, confirming the model relied on contextual and emotive cues rather than simple keyword patterns.
